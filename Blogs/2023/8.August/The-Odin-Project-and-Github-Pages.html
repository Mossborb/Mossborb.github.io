            <h2>The awkward gap from Feburary to August</h2>
            <p>So you may have noticed a small... 6 month gap between this post and the last.
                Where did I go? 
            </p>

            <p>Well, I've traveled around Europe, visiting Germany, Austria, Czech, and Italy for a little bit. 
                As well as starting a new job back in May. In all honesty, I just lost motivation for this project.
            </p>

            <p>Mostly it was a concern about keeping the laptop running for a website that I know no one was going to initially visit.
                I did not want to waste electricity for something like that. However, it all became reignited when I found out about Github Pages.
            </p>

            <h2>Github Pages</h2>

            <p>This wonderful service provided by Github is the saving grace of this project. With it, I no longer need to waste my previous electricity running a page only I was going to look at. 

            </p>

            <p>I was amazed how quickly it took me to set up the website, and change the domain name from Mossborb.github.io to NorbertKnowsIt.com! 
            
            </p>

            <h2>Reigniting the motivation</h2>
            <p>With my old job, working for ADT, installing security systems for my customers, I would work long hours, and come home and want nothing but to sit down and play video games, or watch TV, Netflix, or worst of them all, Youtube Rabbit holes.</p>

            <p>Now life is simpler working as a telemarketer for a local construction company that is about 10 minutes from my home. Immediately I learned everything I needed to from my manager, and got to working on automating my entire job.</p>

            <p>Well... not everything was automated, everything that I could, but I can go more into that in a future post. It's a ... job. That barely pays the bills. I have my wonderful significant other to thank for keeping a roof over our heads.</p>

            <p>The text telemarketing department is trying something new, trying to automate setting appointments with its customers. It has been a rocky road with my managers communicating with the software developers, the devs not understanding our business, them trying one thing, their program not working, it was a whole fiasco. But I am here wading through the waters, trying to make it work so in the end, maybe I could get a nice pay check at the end of the day.</p>

            <h2>The Odin Project</h2>

            <p>I stumbled upon this website with intentions with learning how to flesh out this website, but have gotten interested in becoming a full stack developer. Will it happen? At the current moment, I am unsure. But I like the idea of learning this skill the website has to teach me, and go ahead and start free lancing. Building a portfolio, and maybe securing another job outside of the telemarketing one I have.</p>

            <p>So now I have started the loop again, of picking something up I've started in the past, and trying to push forward a little further than before.</p>

            <p>I now have a schedule which I can plan around, and I have been using that to my advantage by using the morning time to exercise, and read up on what I can during my free hours.</p>

            <p>As of writing this and publishing this post, I have completed 30% of the foundations course.</p>
